This data will regularly change as the SSD shuffles the data around to help prevent a cell of flash from wearing out ahead of the other cells. When there is no DRAM on the SSD, also referred to as DRAM-less SSDs, the data map is stored in system memory or stored on the actual flash cells, which reduces the overall performance of the SSD. However, with the impressive endurance ratings of modern SSDs this extra wear is negligible.\r\nIn NVMe drives, DRAM vs. DRAM-less does not have a relevant impact on performance due to the better optimization of modern DRAM-less drives, and drive wear will not matter to regular users.",

Profiles are stored in a small chip on the DIMMs, and motherboards can read from the chip. From there, you can set your memory to higher than stock speeds.\r\nTo do this, boot into your BIOS and look for settings regarding XMP, AXMP, or DOCP. These are the settings where you will select the XMP profile you wish to use. Commonly they can be found on the main BIOS page, or maybe hidden under overclocking, advanced, or \"AI Tweaker\" tabs within the BIOS.\r\nNOTE: While XMP is generally a stable platform, it is still considered an overclock and may not be 100% stable. XMP profiles are tuned for Intel-based systems and have a higher chance of instability on AMD Ryzen systems.",
